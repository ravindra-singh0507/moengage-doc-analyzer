## Security Best Practices

To protect your MoEngage account, follow these essential security recommendations:

### 1. Strong Authentication

- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for all users to prevent unauthorized access. This adds an extra layer of security by verifying each user's identity.
- **Set up Single Sign-On (SSO)** for organization-wide access using SAML 2.0. This streamlines and secures user authentication.  
  *Need help? Your IT team can assist with SSO setup.*

### 2. Granular Access Controls

- Assign **role-based permissions** to users, giving them only the access they need.
- Use **Campaign Approval Workflows** to oversee and control campaign publishing, ensuring compliance and quality.

### 3. Network Restrictions

- **Enable IP Whitelisting** to restrict access to trusted networks only. Whitelist your VPN IP to further secure platform access.
- Donâ€™t have a VPN? Consider open-source options like **OpenVPN** or **Pritunl**.
- *Note: IP Whitelisting is available only for Enterprise plan users. Contact your Customer Success Manager for more information.*

### 4. User Access Audits

- **Review user access every 2 weeks.** Remove inactive or unnecessary accounts.
- **Minimize the number of Admin and Manager roles.** We recommend having only one Admin per account.
- Regularly review and downgrade roles that no longer require elevated permissions.

### 5. Session Timeout

- MoEngage will log users out after one day of inactivity by default.
- Want to change this? **Raise a support ticket** via the MoEngage Dashboard.
