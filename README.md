# ðŸ“˜ MoEngage Documentation Improvement Agent

This project is a submission for the **MoEngage Tech Intern Assignment**, focused on building an **AI-powered assistant** to improve the quality of public documentation at [help.moengage.com](https://help.moengage.com).

It consists of two agents:

- **Agent 1: Documentation Analyzer** â€” Evaluates an article and generates actionable suggestions.
- **Agent 2: Documentation Rewriter** â€” Optionally rewrites the article using Agent 1's suggestions.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

### Agent 1: Documentation Analyzer

1. **Readability for a Marketer**
2. **Structure and Flow**
3. **Completeness of Information & Examples**
4. **Adherence to Style Guidelines** (based on Microsoft Style Guide)

#### âœ… Output Format

A structured **JSON report** like:

json
{
  "url": "https://help.moengage.com/...",
  "readability": {
    "assessment": "...",
    "suggestions": [...]
  },
  "structure_and_flow": {
    "assessment": "...",
    "suggestions": [...]
  },
  "completeness": {
    "assessment": "...",
    "suggestions": [...]
  },
  "style_guidelines": {
    "assessment": "...",
    "suggestions": [...]
  }
}

Agent 2: Documentation Rewriter (Bonus)
Takes the original article + Agent 1â€™s suggestions and rewrites the content using an LLM. Focuses on:
Improving clarity and tone
Rephrasing passive or complex sentences
Simplifying jargon
